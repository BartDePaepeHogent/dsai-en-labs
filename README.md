# Data Science & AI - Labs

In this repository you will find the lab assignments for the Data Science & AI course. 
The idea is that you make a copy of this repository (using the Github Classroom link you get
during the first classes) and keep your own solutions in that repository.

The repository is divided according to the different modules in the course. In each directory
you will find a `README.md` containing the assignments. The directory `data/` contains all the
datasets you need (and don't have to download from the Internet).

If necessary, create a Jupyter Notebook file to work on your solution.
